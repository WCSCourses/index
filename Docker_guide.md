## Introduction
Docker is a platform that allows you to develop, ship, and run applications inside containers. Containers are lightweight and executable packages of software that include everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. This guide will walk you through the installation process of Docker on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

## Prerequisites
Before installing Docker, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- **macOS**: macOS 10.15 or newer.
- **Windows**: Windows 10 64-bit: Pro, Enterprise, or Education (Build 19041 or higher).
- **Linux**: A 64-bit distribution running kernel version 3.10 or higher.

## Docker Installation on macOS

### 1. Download Docker Desktop
- Visit the [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) page.
- Click on "Download for Mac" to get the installer.

### 2. Install Docker Desktop
- Once the `.dmg` file is downloaded, double-click it to open.
- Drag the Docker icon to the Applications folder.

### 3. Start Docker
- Open the Docker application from the Applications folder.
- Docker will launch and ask for system permissions to install components.
- Enter your system password when prompted.

### 4. Verify Installation
- Open a terminal and run the command:
  ```bash
  docker --version
    ```

---

## Docker Installation on Windows

### 1. Download Docker Desktop
- Visit the [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) download page.
- Click on the "Download for Windows" button.

### 2. Install Docker Desktop
- Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
- Make sure to enable the option to use WSL 2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) during the installation process.

### 3. Verify Installation
- Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and run:
    ```bash
    docker --version
    ```
- This should return the version of Docker installed.

### 4. Run a Test Container
- To verify Docker is working correctly, run:
    ```bash
    docker run hello-world
    ```
- This command downloads and runs a simple container that outputs a confirmation message.

---

## Docker Installation on Linux

### 1. Update Your Package Database
- Open a terminal and run:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    ```

### 2. Install Prerequisites
- Install necessary packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
    ```

### 3. Add Docker’s GPG Key
- Add Docker’s official GPG key:
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
    ```

### 4. Set Up the Stable Repository
- Use the following command to set up the stable repository:
    ```bash
    echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
    ```

### 5. Install Docker
- Update the package database and install Docker:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
    ```

### 6. Add Your User to the Docker Group (Optional but Recommended)
- To avoid using `sudo` for Docker commands, add your user to the `docker` group:
    ```bash
    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
    ```
- After running this command, log out and back in, or restart your system to apply the group changes.

### 7. Verify Installation
- Check if Docker is installed correctly:
    ```bash
    docker --version
    ```

### 8. Run a Test Container
- Run the following command to ensure Docker is functioning:
    ```bash
    docker run hello-world
    ```

## Downloading Docker Image/File via Globus

Globus is a research-oriented file transfer tool that offers the advantage of resuming downloads from the same position in case of an internet connection failure, instead of starting over.

- **Globus Website:** [https://www.globus.org](https://www.globus.org)

## Globus Downloading Steps:

### 1. Create a Globus Connect Personal Account:
   - Visit [Globus Connect Personal](https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-personal) and select the download for your operating system (Mac or Windows). This will prompt you to create an account.
   - Choose to use Globus ID to sign in. (picture below)
   
   ![Download VirtualBox](VM_guide_images/3_1.png)

   - If you don’t have an ID yet, select "Need a Globus ID? Sign up."

   ![Download VirtualBox](VM_guide_images/3_2.png)

   - **IMPORTANT: Make sure to specify that it's for research or educational purposes and create your account. Remember your password for later steps.**

   ![Download VirtualBox](VM_guide_images/3_3.png)

 ### 2. Download the Globus Client:
   - Download the Globus client onto your local machine (or where you intend to run the VM) and allow it to install.
   - It will ask for a collection name; give it a name you'll remember, like "home_computer" or "local_mac." This name refers to the local folders on your computer where we will send the VM in a later step.

### 3. Open Globus File Manager:
   - Click on the small "g" icon on the taskbar and select "Web: Transfer Files."
   - For Linux users: There may not be a shortcut. Start Globus Personal Connect via the command line and navigate to [https://app.globus.org/file-manager](https://app.globus.org/file-manager) to begin the file manager.

### 4. Find Your Files:
   - Your local endpoint is your computer. Click on "Collections" on the left.

### 5. Search for WCS Endpoint:
   - Search for the endpoint `wcs_data_transfers`.
   - Click on the endpoint labeled `wcs_data_transfers` and select "Open in File Manager."

### 6. Transfer the VM:
   - Select the Docker file `CourseName_Year.dockerfile` with the checkbox, then click on "Transfer or sync to."
   - In the opposite panel, click on the search box.

      ![Download VirtualBox](VM_guide_images/3_5.png)

### 7. Choose Local Endpoint:
   - Click on "Your Collections" and select your local endpoint (the name will be what you gave it during the Globus Personal Connect installation).
   - You can also browse to choose the specific directory or folder on your local machine where you want the dockerfile to be downloaded.

      ![Download VirtualBox](VM_guide_images/3_6.png)

### 8. Start the Download:
   - Once you have chosen the local location, click on the "Start" button under the `wcs_data_transfers` section to download to your local endpoint.

      ![Download VirtualBox](VM_guide_images/3_7.png)
      ![Download VirtualBox](VM_guide_images/3_8.png)

### 9. Wait for Completion:
   - Wait for the download to complete. Globus will email you once it's done, and you can track the transfer in the "Activity" menu.

### 10. Build the Docker Image
     ```bash
     docker build -t container_name .
     ```
### 11. Run the Container
     ```bash
     docker run --rm -it container_name /bin/bash
     ```
    
**Note:** The course data is also uploaded on Globus and can be searched as `CourseName_Year.dockerfile`.
