## Introduction to Virtual Box and Virtual Machine

Virtual Box is a cross-platform application developed by Oracle which enables you to create Virtual Machines (VMs). The VM generates a guest operating system (such as Linux) derived from a host operating system. Therefore, sufficient RAM, processors, and memory in the host operating system are essential for smooth running of VMs.

**Note:** The VM image file (.vdi) contains all the software installed for the course.

## Host OS Requirements for Virtual Box

- RAM requirement: 8GB (preferably 12GB)
- Processor requirement: 4 processors (preferably 8)
- Hard disk space: 200GB
- Admin rights to the computer.

**Note:** Please be aware that Virtual Box is currently incompatible with M1/M2/M3 chips on MacBook. It is exclusively designed for use on Intel-based MacBooks. The current version in use is Virtual Box 7.0.

## Installation of Virtual Box for Windows OS

1. **Download VirtualBox:**
   Navigate to the official [VirtualBox website](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and go to the "Downloads" section. Choose the version that matches your Windows operating system (32-bit or 64-bit).
