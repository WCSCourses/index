## What is Linux?

Linux is an open-source operating system based on the Unix architecture. It is widely used for its stability, security, and flexibility, making it a popular choice for servers, desktops, and embedded systems. Linux is free to use and modify, which fosters a collaborative environment where developers and users contribute to its continuous improvement.

## Why is Linux Popular in Bioinformatics?

Linux is particularly favoured in the bioinformatics field for several reasons:
- **Open Source**: Many bioinformatics tools and software are developed for Linux, allowing researchers to access and modify the source code as needed.
- **Stability and Performance**: Linux systems are known for their robustness and ability to handle large datasets and complex computations efficiently, which is crucial in bioinformatics.
- **Community and Support**: The Linux community provides extensive resources and support, facilitating collaboration among researchers.
- **Compatibility with Tools**: A significant number of bioinformatics tools and pipelines are designed to run on Linux, making it the preferred platform for many researchers.
